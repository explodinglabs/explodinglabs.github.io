How to add email aliases and reply from the same address the original email was
sent to.

# Add aliases

First the aliases need to be added in the mail server's web admin.

## Zoho Mail

Login to Zoho mail admin.

https://mailadmin.zoho.com.au/cpanel/home.do#users/list

Click the hamburger menu top left, and click Users.

Click Add email alias next to your user. (Click the vertical ellipsis to open
the drop-down)

Click + Add to add an alias.

Add the new email address. (Don't tick "set as mailbox address")

## Google Workspace

Open admin.google.com

Click the hamburger menu > Directory > Users.

Click your user.

Click ADD ALTERNATE EMAILS.

Add the alias.

# Reply from the same address the original email was sent to

The above aliases will work, but in order to reply from the same email address
the email was sent to, the addresses also need to added to the email apps.

## MacOS Mail

Open the app.

Go to Mail > Settings.

In the Accounts tab, click the account.

Click Email Addresses and ad the address.

## iOS Mail

Go to Settings > Mail > Mail Accounts.

Click the account.

Go to Account Settings.

Click Email, and add the address.

Note the account must be an IMAP account, otherwise you can't add aliases. If
you added it as a Google account, add it again as "Other".
