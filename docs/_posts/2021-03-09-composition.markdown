<div id="intro" markdown="1">
Engineers achieve big things by solving little problems. If we can solve all
the little problems, we can combine the solutions to solve bigger problems.
</div>

Why do we break down problems? This is due to the limitations of the human mind --
we can only deal with a small number of concepts at a time, so we break down
problems, and break them down again until they're just the right size that
we can mentally digest them.

We solve each problem, zooming in to focus on a single arrow, ignoring
everything else.

In programming we solve small problems by writing functions; these are
expressions that get you from _a_ to _b_.

Finally, we zoom out again to combine the solutions.
