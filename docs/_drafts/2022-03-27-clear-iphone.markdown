When my iPhone or iCloud is full, this is what I do.
</div>

1. Plug an SSD and the iPhone into the Mac.
2. Open Photos on Mac. When it asks, trust the Mac.
3. When it asks, import any newer files to Photos.
4. Go to "Library", select all and `File > Export > Export all unmodified
   originals`. Set the destination to a new directory on the SSD under `iPhone
   11 Pro Max > (Today's date)`. Then click "Export Originals".
5. Also on the Mac, delete all files from Photos. It will delete them from the
   phone as well.
6. Delete from Recently Deleted as well (in Photos)
