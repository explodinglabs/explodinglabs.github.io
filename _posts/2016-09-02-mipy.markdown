I've put a little script on PyPi that copies files onto a NodeMCU or other
serial device running Micropython. It's basically a fork of Nick Moore's
[mpy-utils](https://github.com/nickzoic/mpy-utils), with nice command-line
options thanks to [click](https://github.com/pallets/click).

To use it, install [mipy](https://github.com/bcb/mipy) with pip:

    $ pip install mipy

Now you can copy files to the device:

    $ mipy cp main.py

You can also set the port, baudrate and other options. See `mipy --help`.

```sh
Usage: mipy [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

  Manage files with Micropython

Options:
  -b, --baud <rate>      Port speed in baud (default is 115200).
  -i, --interrupt        Send soft interrupt (ctrl-c) before command.
  -p, --port <port>      Serial port device (default is /dev/ttyUSB0).
  -r, --reset            Send soft reset (ctrl-d) after copy.
  -t, --timeout INTEGER  Timeout.
  --help                 Show this message and exit.

Commands:
  cp  Copy files to Micropython
```

My typical workflow is to make a change, then copy it to the board with `mipy
-ir`:

    $ mipy -ir cp main.py

This interrupts the running script, copies the file, then does a soft-reset.
